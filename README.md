# Another Arrow Direction

Here's an alternative to Impulse's Arrow Direction minigame. <br />
This project was done as a technical test for Voodoo, and during my workday at Capgemini. <br />
I received the test on 25-07-2024 at 0910 am and my last commit (for the test, and excepting the commit for this readme commit) was pushed at 1057 pm. <br />

## Principle

- User have to swipe in the direction indicated by the arrow on the screen
- A modifier can impact the way user should swipe
- The more the arrow is at the center of the bubble, the more points user will earned
